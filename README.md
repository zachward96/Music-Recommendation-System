# Music-Recommendation-System
This is a music recommendation system that I built using the million songs dataset for my capstone project in the MIT applied data science program.

The data for this project is pulled directly from the million songs dataset. If trying to run this project on your own computer make sure to download that first. The song count data should be labeled count_df and the song info data should be labeled song_df.
